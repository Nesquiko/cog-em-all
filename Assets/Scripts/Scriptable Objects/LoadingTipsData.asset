  tips:
  - "Flamethrowers can\u2019t rotate automatically \u2014 use manual rotation mode
    to cover new angles."
  - You earn passive gears over time. Keep building even during lulls between waves!
  - "Selling a tower refunds some gears \u2014 use it to reposition your defensive
    strategy."
  - "Remember: upgrades and rotations pause towers \u2014 plan adjustments between
    waves."
  - Upgrading a tower early is often stronger than building a new one.
  - "Selling and rebuilding is part of the strategy \u2014 adapt to enemy paths."
  - "Not all waves need more towers \u2014 sometimes better positioning is enough."
  - Mortars deal massive area damage but struggle with fast targets.
  - "Flamethrowers dominate close range \u2014 place them where enemies bunch up."
  - "Stim modes trade control for power \u2014 activate when you can commit."
